If you've got ground meat any variation of a keema: [https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/keema-recipe-mutton-keema-curry/](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/keema-recipe-mutton-keema-curry/) works, and enough to fry up some for the pup.

If you can get clean goat trotters, [https://www.kannammacooks.com/attukal-paya-mutton-paya/](https://www.kannammacooks.com/attukal-paya-mutton-paya/)

Easy with a whole chicken or certain pieces: [https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/andhra-chicken-curry-recipe-kodi-kura-with-step-by-step-pictures/](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/andhra-chicken-curry-recipe-kodi-kura-with-step-by-step-pictures/)

Fish: [https://www.yummytummyaarthi.com/andhra-fish-fry-recipe-andhra-chepa/](https://www.yummytummyaarthi.com/andhra-fish-fry-recipe-andhra-chepa/)

You can use the spicy blend whole for pomfret and slice and marinate cover with foil and bake.

As for fish steaks that's sort of where it gets dicey, as in where I'm where they use Rohu (a type of carp) or Kingfish, Ilish (herring type) is used for curries or stews. But these spices translate well for cheaper seafood like shrimp - but usually not worth your dollar if you're in prime seafood territory.

For something hearty - Sambar, or even Rasam if you have the ingredients (namely Tamarind). It's my regions ""soup"" for the soul.

If you're grown any vegetables and want to make chuntey lmk.

Lastly: If you have access to the lentils: [https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/dosa-recipe-dosa-batter-recipe/](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/dosa-recipe-dosa-batter-recipe/)

Homemade dosa is a game-changer. Ideally a dosa is much crisper than a crepe, like shatteringly thing - but it's hard to get that at home so homemade dosas do functionally have the same feel as a crepe - galette bretonne range.

I have been spoiled due to never being taught structuredly  ( cooking) just reading online and experimenting got me this way, where I forget for a moment that people are looking for specific taste when they think Indian or northern or southern dish. Or even in Bangladesh for example, they have regional differences in spicing style. So I'm sure people are looking for specific taste and not just do what you feel like from the spice cupboard.",2025-01-24 04:38:22

Thank you. I once met someone from Hyderabad, I met this lady at Toronto , Canada. There was a hydrabadi restaurant I've been to,  there near by, so I told her about it. She did get a tad furious because ""you can't get hydrabadi food outside of Hyderabad because the water doesn't taste the same and also spices don't taste the same across the world"" ....and she did have a very good point...

Never the less I did order the hydrabadi biriyani :D 

I love rahu and Hilsa it is just hard to get it at my end of the world, and a cousin of mine told me that rohu must be available naturally where we are but it may not be recognised as an edible fish here which is totally possible. But I love the silver pomfret, rahu, hilsa for sure. And the jumbo shrimp I have only seen at the Indian end of the world never seen it here in North american side (definitely not that size).

But simplest way to approach cooking any vegetable dishes, would be to prepare the stuff for the base (if its just masalas then thats easy), the vegetables to add (you need to cut them and prep), and then get started. If you can ask your mom (she will be more than happy to teach you I'm pretty sure) what are the types of bases or vegs she will tell you.

for mains, easy ones are just making some rice (use rice cooker or boil rice, usually for white rice its 1 cup rice to 1.5 cup water, for brown you need 2 cups water.) or something like dosai/similar things, or upma (the semolina/rava one).

Using flour to thicken sauces isn't common (in fact, off the top of my head, the only things that are thickened with flour use gram flour to do so). 

So it would be easier to give you a list of foods to avoid than a list of gluten free foods, as that would be a very long list containing almost everything which isn't bread!

There are a few ingredients to watch out for which can contain ""hidden gluten"", asafoetida in particular often contains a little wheat flour (but can also be made with rice flour or other gluten free flours). If you're extremely sensitive to gluten then it's worth checking that all the spices used were processed in a gluten free environment 

Is this for recipes to make for yourself, or are you looking for guidance in ordering from restaurants and takeaways? If making Indian food for yourself I'd say you don't even need to actively seek out gluten free recipes, since so few Indian recipes which aren't bread rely on gluten-containing ingredients. If it's for eating out or ordering in, it's best to check with the restaurant themselves as it's hard to predict which items might contain gluten (they might have their own version of a recipe which contains unexpected gluten), also they may not take precautions to avoid contamination.",2025-01-20 13:25:13
