We're hurting right now, and many of us feel additionally worried for our safety. This subreddit still has a purpose and will go on. The aims of this subreddit include:

1. To expose the threat posed by Donald Trump and the modern day Republican party to US democracy.
2. To campaign for Donald Trump to face justice for his crimes.
3. To expose the ways media companies, including social media, have been complicit in misinforming the public.

To increase these odds, you need to work on your personal statement.  The summary reveals that it's incredibly superficial. You might want to tie in a sports background, such as soccer or basketball, to discuss how being part of a team added an important element to your debate and non-profit work. Maybe work in a discussion of books by your favorite author, and explain how identity plays a role in every aspect of what you accomplish.  Or you can discuss a song that has a connection to you, like Pumped up Kicks, and how the troubling issues facing teens today make it even harder to achieve success. Again, I know your post is just a summary, but usually chat GPT pulls out important highlights and they just weren't in what you provided.

If you need help with the essay, you might want to ask an incredible writer to help out. If you know any lawyers, you might reach out to them because they're known for making persuasive arguments in an interesting and relatable way. If you're looking for a referral, I would suggest talking to Graham or MaryBeth, although the latter is a stronger writer.

**Ticker:** INTC

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:** Bullish on INTC for 2025, due to potential shift to foundry business model and anticipated government support under new administration.  OP believes INTC could become the ""US TSMC"".

**Hopium Level:** High. OP owns 575 shares.

**Key Argument:**  Current geopolitical climate favors domestic chip manufacturing. OP believes the next administration will support INTC's foundry business through tariffs and other measures, potentially leading to INTC spinning off its product division (maybe to AMD?!) and becoming a pure-play foundry.",2024-12-07 07:17:20

Pat’s time as CEO was largely focused on the foundry business. There he made tremendous strides and as long as things follow through and intel executes with its foundry business, it could turn out very well. 

A lot of intels failings in the client market with raptor lake, arrow lake, and arc are a score spot. However, the average consumer has no clue about any of it. Most laptops still run Intel chips and most consumers are of the mindset, “core i7 good”, regardless of the fact that sku has a U suffix. They also still hold a strong lead in server due to a lot of that same legacy mind share. Really intels “mind share” has really only been demolished in the enthusiast space where people are privy to how shit intels products are compared to amd when it comes to power efficiency and value. 

I don’t see how Intel can catch up when it comes to product. They need a totally clean sheet for desktop on the cpu. I’m not holding my breath. 

AMD and TSMC have a partnership which has yielded significant advancements when it comes to advanced packaging. Things like Mi300 and 9800x3D are products that come to mind. Intel doesn’t have any real answer to this right now. If their foundry business is to succeed in the future they need to prove they can do these things at the same cost and scale as TSMC. Advanced packaging and chiplets are one of the next big things required to remain competitive in the space. Advanced packaging is essential for Intel foundry. 

Word is that Intel is in talks with some companies about a potential sale of parts of its business. Chances are they are gonna put in a ceo well atunes to that role. Whatever happens is anyone’s guess. A lot of names are being thrown around in regard to who may be buying part of the business.

When you wait for stuff to hurt badly before trying to take meds, you end up needing higher dosages more often and it's harder to get under control. Also, as somebody that was on a stupid amount of Dilaudid post op (had a PCA and could give myself 1.5mg every 15 minutes for max of 144mg a day, plus needed some methadone and ketamine on top of that for pain – I had a previous tolerance to pain medication that was very high), they have medications they can give you to make sure you don't get too backed up. There's one called methylnaltrexone that is an opioid antagonist but only for the peripheral opioid receptors in your body. So basically it reverses the opioid receptors in your gut that cause constipation without affecting how much pain relief you get from the meds. It's awesome. Except for when the nurse gives it to you and can't answer the call bell quick enough when it kicks in so you take a giant shit all over yourself and the chair they have you in in the CTICU because you can't get yourself up and to the commode lmao.",2024-12-07 06:57:32

I don’t galavant around downtown visiting local businesses and shopping. How many of you stick around work afterwards to hang out? I go the fuck home because I have shit to do. You are delusional if you think this is anything but classic boomer bullshit. keith is pandering, and to the right dummies it will Work. But forcing a 1000 pissed off office workers who don’t want to be downtown to be there 4+ days a week will do nothing but cause labor union woes (3 huge labor unions are negotiating right now- Kieth poured fuel on the fire in the most ret@rded possible way, before even starting in office lmao)

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both `DCSbot` and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/Rude_Respond3628.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

Hm, Alex, I wonder who ever thought up the idea of ""asking the jury to deprive a citizen of his constitutional rights?""  Has that, maybe, ever happened to a CRIMINAL defendant at literally every single criminal trial?  And you'll still have your first amendment rights, which don't include defamation anyway.  They're just taking away THIS studio and THIS brand name.  You can still blather on via other means.  Unfortunately.

And is this word salad because of AI, or voice-to-text, or what?  This document is quickly becoming unreadable as the author/typist continues to apparently stroke out.",2024-12-07 03:51:37

As a former litigator, though, a few things jump out at me.

First, and people won't want to hear this, there are arguments here that may have meat on their bones. I don't think they're correct arguments, and I expect Tetrahedron to be confirmed as the winning bidder. But there's possibly some issues here to get hashed out. And unless you're conversant with the bankruptcy code, you don't know--just as I don't know--exactly how strong those arguments are. The court may well take some time diving into some of these arguments on Monday, and I'd just ask readers that if you aren't conversant with the bankruptcy code you please stop and ask yourself whether you have an educated opinion about second-guessing the court on technical matters.

Second, and people will be more amenable to this perspective, this is a dogshit motion. I've heard from local practitioners that these are respected attorneys, which makes me wonder what's going on behind the scenes. This whole process is happening in a big rush, by the standards of federal court, but even so the motion here is littered with basic mistakes. Spelling and grammar mistakes are serious in legal pleadings, for various reasons, but not least because they show a lack of care that courts can impute to the substantive merits of the arguments. If someone can't be assed to correct ""obsticle"" in a heading, did they really cite check all the cases?

But the problems go beyond the superficial here. Paragraphs 32 and 34 should be the lynchpins of the movants' arguments. If they're right about these legal questions--and they may be!--then the judge may have to overturn the sale. But there's no citations to legal authorities in either paragraph, which makes me dubious about whether it's an accurate statement of applicable law. The court will share that skepticism, likely. And paragraph 34 doesn't even contain factual support for the monetary loss alleged. It's also rife with glaring grammatical errors, like a first sentence that someone forgot to finish before dropping a period on it.

Long story short, the poor work in the motion strongly suggests to me that the Jones parties are behind the 8 ball. BUT without really knowing the legal technicalities at issue, it's impossible to say for sure. And the fact that the Texas plaintiffs aren't lining up behind the Connecticut plaintiffs fully is going to put the judge on edge. (As it should; the court's duty is to respect the rights of all the creditors.)

I'd bet money on Tetrahedron winning on Monday. These filings don't change that. But I really wish we had a resident bankruptcy expert to lend us their insight.

No criticism of u/OregonSmallClaims intended or implied. I very much appreciate their diligence and courtesy in providing screencaps and links, and enjoy reading their commentary.",2024-12-07 06:43:19

So, there were NO ""express statements"" made by AJ that were libelous, claimed in the original court filing?  None at all?  I'm not going to go read it right now, but I HIGHLY doubt that is true.

Oh, you're bringing examples?  Great!  Oh, the green screen, and Robbie asking if he should read off the card (his own notes to organize his thoughts, NOT a cue card)?  Those weren't explicit enough for you?  Sure, those ""clipped"" versions aren't necessarily libelous on their own, news anchors talk in front of (not behind, idiot) green screens all the time.  Robbie DID have cards to read off of.  But it was the greater CONTEXT that made those things libelous/defamatory, doofus.  AJ accused Robbie Parker of being an actor who DIDN'T have a dead kid, not just reading off of cards.  And he accused Anderson Cooper of being in on the larger conspiracy of gun control nuts trying to take away guns by PRETENDING kids were killed when they actually weren't.  THAT's the part that's defamatory.  You gotta show the WHOLE VIDEO, not just a little clip, right, ALEX?

And similarly, whining that the families want to hold AJ responsible for things Halbig said.  Not just things Halbig said in a vacuum, completely unrelated to Alex, you idiot.  Alex quoted him, recommended him as an expert, had him on the show, recommended people read and watch his materials.  THAT's why it's mentioned in the complaint.  (Plus, wasn't Halbig part of the suit at first?  Or was it a separate suit?  Or another nutjob that was included?  I forget all the details.)",2024-12-07 04:03:18

Okay, and then the rest of the actual text on that page is just STILL whining that default judgements aren't a thing.

It's the day Mike Johnson seats the new house.  If Democrats storm the Capitol on that day, the house doesn't get seated (although the existing house is still majority R, and they would still certify Trump's win on J6, unless.... Democrats OCCUPY that too).

So there's your day to protest.  It's reciprocal in that Democrats get to do what Maga did 4 years ago.  No moral high ground anymore.  (Well there's no ground period after Trump 2.0 tears up democracy and the Constitution.)

We have a date.  It's memorable.  It's etched into our souls four years ago.  In fact, if there is no protest in D.C. on that day, then dictator Trump will feel even more emboldened to take his reign.  As Timothy Snyder says, do not give in by default.

I have zero ideas on how to handle what’s coming and I’d rather have references  ahead of time 

Imho rather than just learning about fascism to focus I’m more interested on learning how to defeat it,  fascism will be described along the way. Hoping we won’t need it. 

FWIW Here’s some to start:

Just found Rachel madows book (preorder) 
https://www.amazon.com/Prequel-American-Fight-Against-Fascism/dp/0593444515?dplnkId=a590e78d-5127-439b-be2e-68bdc39f9eb2&nodl=1

There are other books which are recommended by others to understand fascism like strongmen by Ruth Ben Ghiat or 
On freedom by Timothy Snyder which gets quoted here a lot I think. 

Teri Kanefield has a graphic book on the constitution coming out (preorder available) on the constitution.

I ordered all those as presents for my husband lol.

And then there is us, the alleged greatest most powerful nation on Earth... just taking it in the teeth. Just continuing a peaceful transition of power to total chaos. Every elected official not in the bought and paid for Russian party just went on like nothing was different, that the mandate of defensive democracy wasn't the clearest and utmost priority in 2020.

And all those three letter agencies of ours, many of whom have histories of truly diabolical coloring outside the lines of the law and morality itself to allegedly 'protect the country': Like murdering whole families of Black Panthers while they slept with machine gun fire, dogging Martin Luther King 'til the day he died, selling crack in inner city black communities to fund external operations they couldn't get funding for by congress because they were so fucked up even they wouldn't co-sign the checks for, spying on and blacklisting whole swathes of Hollywood as communists ending their careers, finding and executing the Rosenburgs, finding and executing Che Guevara, toppling governments around the world with coup d'etats... and they just sat there and took it in the fucking teeth.

They didn't lift a goddamn finger when we became a **client state of** ***RUSSIA***, their touted primary enemy since the end of WW2 who was the reason they did 90% of that horrible shit in the first place.

Legendary? I wouldn't say what they've done is ""legendary."" They are cloaked more in mystique than actual attributed deeds they've managed to accomplish. I'm not a fan that they helped WikiLeaks get money, only for Julian Assange to drop stuff about Hillary Clinton right before the 2016 election in an act that many thought was to benefit Trump.

They did ""Operation Darknet,"" which took down a CP site, but that industry has exploded since then. They then joined the fight in 2022 to support Ukraine, but that petered out.

In 2015-2016, Anonymous declared a ""cyberwar"" against Trump before he was elected, and they literally did nothing. Then, during his presidency, all they did was release unverified claims about Trump's personal and financial dealings. And it all went nowhere.

Honestly, all Anonymous seems to be these days is guys who like the movie *V for Vendetta* and want to cosplay a freedom fighter. They put on a dark hoodie and the Guy Fawkes mask and add an artificial voiceover to their video while they gently turn their head from the side like they're talking while someone has a laser globe from Spencer Gifts on in the room.

In a way we can be comfortable in our misery. Does that make sense?
The US has not been in this sort of crisis, maybe ever but certainly not in many peoples lifetimes. The concept of a general strike goes against everything we’ve grown up with or have been taught. People could lose their jobs and that’s enough to keep a decent portion of the people in line. Especially now that employers can fire people for calling in sick.

They have too.

How else will they spread their toxicity.

If they build a game solely for their crowd, it wouldn't sell for they don't have the population - we've seen that with Dustborn.

Whereas injecting it into a beloved series will sell and the game won't commit sudoku, such as Dragon Age, but it definitely took a hit.

Now they will do it to GTAVI and THAT will sell like hotcakes no matter how bad it is.",2024-12-07 02:38:00

I am pointing this out because we should push for more investigations, not just dismiss things and trust things will go well. Even while “optimistic”, you cannot be blind to the past behaviors and evidences. And more importantly, we shouldn’t be attacking investigators and whistleblowers just because their investigations aren’t perfect. We should be pushing to continue the investigations, instead of going back to sleep just because of these accusations (like in the video you linked) against the investigator affirming our wishes for the game.

You asked what is considered a “win” for our “side” (GG’s individuals are so different it is really hard to consider it a “side”). It isn’t just changing the games or even the laws back to the freedom versions from before. It is to make sure the culture goes back to the way before. Because the culture creates the people who create laws and games. Right now SJW culture is extremely malicious and regressive.

What is the difference between SJW culture and the culture before? SJW culture is a culture of **fear**. Think about it. Everyone now has to fear how SJWs use centralized power against them of they forget to appease them, even in this sub, where certain topics are banned. People need to put trigger warnings, they need to be careful of the jokes they make, they must fear depicting any group “wrongly”, they need to fear “cultural appropriation” or if they didn’t hire the SJW “consultants”. They need to fear being banned from platforms, even when it is their livelihood and they didn’t break any laws. And even some when they are innocent.

Compare to before. People could make offensive jokes, could make a game depiction any way they wanted, they could take any cultural thing and use it in their game, and if anyone criticizes, there is no censorship, they just openly give the arguments. And in the old culture, everyone learned new things about cultures, even when they were wrongly depicted, because people investigated for themselves.

Look at Rockstar before. They made fun of everyone, even though religious and anti-government things were very sensitive. But now they need to be fearful of “punching down”, if certain religions or groups are depicted badly, so they needed to even censor the remasters of the works from the past. Look at Tomb Raider. They needed to change her body type and make lots of statements with their work against what came before and the fans.

The sub you quoted is literal gaslighting. They claim we are the “last gasp of resistance” as if they are snuffing out an evil faction, but the truth is SJWs are the invaders gloating over oppressing and destroying the innocent native fans with central tyrannical power. Also, they claim it is the “last gasp”, when before this they could not even be openly cricitized, and GG finally now has an even playing field. Back then, SJWs had control over so many central institutions like credit card companies, media studios, tech companies and even governments, and only now it is finally being revealed and criticized with evidence. Before, the criticisms and investigations were silenced before it could even get that far. But now there is a long memory of what SJWs have done over many years, so people don’t trust them as easily any more.

Now people are investigating. And people do not like what the SJWs have done.",2024-12-07 07:28:58

I know that seems kind of vague, [but I read an interesting article by Jewish Currents about If Not Now trying to redefine itself post-Trump](https://jewishcurrents.org/what-happened-to-ifnotnow) and in the face of Israel's escalating brutality. The landmark reports on apartheid came out in 2021 and now, we're witnessing a genocide on live-stream.

I think this year has shown a wide range of activist groups opposing the genocide - which is great and something we all would hope to happen under such circumstances.

That being said, there are politicians who are traditionally seen as progressive or representative of the progressive base of the Democratic party - but who are distrusted by some anti-Zionist activist groups and figures.

I myself have at times become really disillusioned with some politicians for being outspoken about Palestinian human rights but then supporting Biden. 

And at the same time, I remember posting an article about Cori Bush vs. AIPAC on Reddit and receiving criticism because it came across (to the critics) as me supporting all of her politics which were deemed not leftist enough and yada yada. I don't personally know everything about her, but she was being challenged by AIPAC and I thought that was important enough to have a discussion about or raise awareness about.

AIPAC has been using GOP dark money to push out progressive critics of Israel from the Democratic party. 

Can you explain your position on this topic - ie, what kind of infighting have you seen or experienced even when it's about pushing back against AIPAC going after progressives? Thank you.",2024-12-07 02:16:50

There's all sorts of crazy news about Trump's mass deportation schemes and whatnot. 

I've read articles [where police chiefs have said they would help immigrants](https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-police-trump-immigration-deportation-crackdown-1bc712bb3642edd7e05f2164e8d3a9c0) and [disobey Trump's orders](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/01/nx-s1-5164531/deportations-local-police-sheriff-trump-border-immigrants).

Any insight into what activists are preparing to do about this? I ask with the wording 'preparing to do' because I know there are NGOs already working to oppose Trump policies.

Because I was raised to be an unquestioning Zionist, one who believed there was always an explanation for its daily human rights abuses and history, it felt much easier to me to join a group like IfNotNow, as opposed to JVP, SJPs, and other groups back then. Mostly because they offered an entry level way to get involved, using a wide and welcoming strategy for people who were not yet critical of Zionism itself. But deeply concerned with what we may not have seen to be the violent and rotten fruits of Zionism.

So today, as these groups so beautifully put aside their different strategies, dramas, and the (sometimes) different communities (and front doors) they hold, in order to be in total solidarity together for Gaza, and beginning to sound more and more alike I'm starting to wonder if someone like me back then would still have a way to enter and learn and evolve. But I am also aware that may be shortsighted, because of how radicalizing what is happening in Gaza is, perhaps it's more important to make those higher asks of people now rather than offer a pathway to them.

One thing I do appreciate that seems to have stayed the same, are how JVP is primarily about how to show up in solidarity with Palestinians in a very outward way. Beautiful. And how INN is primarily helping Jews who are looking inward and examining how and why we got here, and how to free ourselves from harming ourselves. Beautiful too.",2024-12-07 01:40:26

Photos, videos, livestreams. I've helped organize some. I think they're all important because each one offers people just coming into activism a first stop. Something they're nervous to do but think they can do. So we have to always keep in mind that these actions aren't just for a direct pay off, but to begin to bring people in on a path. To become more skilled in non violent resistance, and braver. To build networks for resilience and to even prepare their loves and families and even jobs and bosses (if applicable) for how to support them or manage.

I also think we don't do enough actions that impact people's money.

While I don't think it's ever futile to invest time in changing hearts and minds, I do sometimes wonder if it's the best use of time. Zionists, including me when I was young, are time suckers. Some on purpose, sure. Some just by the nature of psychology at play. You can throw logic at someone all you want but if their inner voice knows that if you are right, their parents, congregation, Rabbi, teacher, sister, partner have all been wrong -- it creates a resistance that is sometimes reenforced by argument, rather than defeated.    
  
It takes a LOT of time to move people, especially those who are not used to being uncomfortable like middle or upper class white people (and many others across identity) And patience. But one thing I learned is your job isn't to change their minds A to Z. It's to plant seeds that they'll have to examine on their own later. It's a community effort. You want them to feel ""I don't agree with that person but they're nice and they're right about so much else, I wonder..."" vs ""Wow that person and other people won't ike me if I continue to think this way"". They'll just find people who will. As the Jewish tradition says, “**You are not required to finish your work, yet neither are you permitted to desist from it.”**

However, back to my own sometimes dilemma. In this moment, for every one Zionist who wants to talk endlessly with me I could likely organize 20 people ready and willing to hit the streets, make calls, knock doors and show up tomorrow. So I tend to focus on that. However, if someone is truly curious, I will try. But only to plant seeds. Not grow a tree.",2024-12-07 02:18:57

What you're raising is such a critical friction in this work especially in this time. There are a lot of takes on this I can share, but I believe enough in mine that I'm going to focus there. And that is Palestinians and everyone under every boot, gun or prison roof here and around the world deserves our movements to practice a diversity of tactics.

They can be electoral. Street movements. Boycotts. Work stoppages or slowdown. Impact litigation, and so on. But I want to see a culture emerge where we choose which fight we want to experiment with, and put our energy to that instead of trying to discredit another tactic.

And I find it reassuring to know that when I was also criticized for favoring electoral tactics of people like Cori Bush or Rashida Tlaib on Gaza, I was told I was abandoning Palestinians. Yet, I was following Palestinian leadership in doing so. As do many people in street movements and other groups. So yeah, if it's about Palestinians, I want to be led by Palestinians. However, their leaders are embodying a diversity of tactics and we can choose which one we want to join.

Some of them will fail, which is good information. And even good process. When something fails it saves us all time later. And it fills the ranks elsewhere where things are working. With experienced people. It also moves people along. But imagine investing everything in one tactic and watching it fail? Where do people go? This is all incubation.

Now, even among those who are otherwise progressive, it feels more impossible. What I have noticed among them is those who did come with a foundation, like socialism, remained consistent. I also learned that I was unprepared in capacity to offer any political education process. A pathway for people to come to their own conclusions about it, based on a curriculum that felt respectful and applicable to their lives. Groups like IfNotNow, SURJ and Asians4Palestine have done this well. But I was on my own, and perhaps it's something others want to join me in creating?",2024-12-07 02:45:38

Outside of small grassroots donation asks, asking for small amounts isn't about the money at all. The non profits just know that psychologically you will feel more invested in their work if you feel you've contributed to them. In fact, it often costs them more to market and process your donation than your donation. Because the value is in moving you to build a relationship. But you're already down and motivated, so skip the money unless you have reasonably disposable income, because you're already a person who gives a fuck.  
  
There are many more valuable ways a person who gives a fuck can participate without money. Ask yourself what  are the things you're good at (or things you want to be good at, even if it's not tied directly to activism), and some of them may have direct application.   
  
I have friends who don't like to leave the house, they like to research. Some are spreadsheet or data nerds. Some want to learn how to train to be medics or security for protests. Some want to learn how to train to speak to strangers. Walk more. All these things have applications across the movement, and some of them are in high demand. Especially when it's something that you enjoy and doesn't seem like work. Especially if it's something many people don't enjoy and it would seem like work. It can be as simple as ""I like to people watch"", lol, and I'll say, ""have you tried court watching?"". Court watching used to be done by the press. It kept judges and lawyers in line and accountable, protecting people in the most vulnerable times of their lives. Any person can take the place of that journalist who is long gone and make those people accountable again. Are you patient and have hours to kill sometimes? You can pay bails. You don't even have to use your money in many locales. You just have to wait around ugly broken lights and yellow walls for hours while reading a book. All this work builds our communities and networks. And that's what we need to build to survive and win against what's coming.

And so are others across many orgs.

I like to remind folks that when Obama won by one of the largest margins in history (Trumps is among the narrowest, even as he claims a mandate) the Republicans were able to thwart many of even his centrist actions across his entire tenure. And it was during that Democrat control groups like the Tea Party came along and pushed the GOP radically right. It's not exactly apples to apples but we have the potential to do the same within the system. However, I think we must build our movements and their resilience to not only push that, but to be there if that fails.

We build these movements by joining mutual aid to distribute coats and food, not tomorrow, now.  By knowing all our neighbors so that the first time you knock on their door isn't when you need critical help, but when you need sugar. Joining or creating unions. Coops. By researching preparedness, and not the type that reenforces insularity and hoarding, but community and dividing up roles so you rely on each other.

We cannot predict the shape and form our power will need to take. But we can build our power. We can prepare people to be healthy, supported, resilient, informed, and specialized in things just by being there for each other now. It sounds cheesy as hell but making it your mission to know the neighbors you never speak to and build depth with, will save us.

Allowing dominant culture to continue to insulate us into our phones and filtered bubbles will make us weaker and weaker.

Am grateful for places like this that encourage to utilize both the power of online community and finding people like us, and also taking what we learn from each other to people outside the bubbles.",2024-12-07 02:56:37

But I am also aware that may be shortsighted, because of how radicalizing what is happening in Gaza is, perhaps it's more important to make those higher asks of people now rather than offer a pathway to them.

You bring up an excellent point about entry-way into changing one's perspective.

And I also agree that the reality of 2014, as bad as Protective Edge was - is really different compared to the genocide of 2023-2024+.

This “imperial” is the more concerning nomenclature. I suppose it could work something  like Jefferson’s “empire of liberty”but even that terminology route was perhaps ill advised, given the way they went on to to _liberate_” the land from its indigenous population. Empire and imperial have remained persistent problems—even growing worse. So such nomenclature is not advised. The other nomenclature you highlight is not really objectionable relative to empire and imperial. 

“Imperial legion” is particularly jarring.
 

> Political System

> meritocratic instead of demagogic

How can merit be at odds with speaking for the people: the demos? The most meritorious to rise to the position to develop and implement _policy_ are those speaking for the _polis_ and thus faithfully deploying the powers of the _polis_, , by being dutiful servants to the _polis_, according to the superior law of the  _polity_. The polis is the entity denoting the unified collective form of the demos. The demos and the polis is necessarily compromised of the diverse plural identities constituting them. Those who do not recognize the voice of this diverse constituency have absolutely zero merit to serve the polis and the demos. 
 
> Imperial Socialism acknowledges that no system is incorruptible. However, corruption can be managed and suppressed through rigorous processes, checks and balances, and oversight. 

 Sounds reasonable. However, much of our corruption, and outright treason, today arises from a cultivated authoritarian personality disorder plaguing the polis and demos. The minutiae of the polity are insignificant compared to the complete vacuum created by this cultivated civic ignorance among the People. The different rules regulating government are path dependent artifacts of our history. What you propose might be better the same or worse than what we already have. However the massive subterfuge that degrades and demoralizes the citizenry will render the best laid plans of mice and men entirely impotent. Best, therefore to focus on fixing the citizenry rather than rearranging deckchairs on our titanic’s upper deck.

Sounds much like inspector generals we have today. 

> Core tenets: Collectivism, materialism, anthropocentrism, universalism, and utilitarianism. Citizens may believe what they wish (to a degree) but joining the Meritocracy or the Senate requires swearing an oath to uphold the Imperial Charter.  

Utilitarianism is the only core tenet that is genuinely core in what you list: the others are either superfluous, antagonistic to utilitarianism, or can be directly deduced from utilitarianism (depending upon how they are conceived).",2024-12-07 03:48:55

Hoping you can clarify something for me - as an FYI, I believe I carefully read the pre-amble you offered, and I skimmed the rest. 

I don't totally understnd everything which follows from this ideology. And so without trying to ""jump into your mind"", I can see an ideology saying, ""Well the state of nature is brutal, because it's really hard to secure habitation and beyond this, and ***it's even so obvious*** life gets better when you move beyond it,"" I think this is philosophical. 

I can even accept some argument about production, secular/scientific creating the political, and this space is the thing itself which wills itself out. 

However, I don't understand how the ideology asks so much beyond this? Hence like trans-technological-futurism is like a really bad idea IMO.....for example (and sorry....sheesh....), why do open borders matter? Why care about democratic norms in the first place? Why does meritocracy become more important than other systems of deciding how technocratic societies can work?

> 
> Market Socialism

A misnomer. Socialism does not imply any one allocation mechanism over any other, except so as to strive for the best allocation mechanism science can devise made available to all vendors and buyers. If markets, stewarded and made more perfect by a socialist Commonwealth, serve well those vendors and buyers, they will make use of them. If the vendors and buyers prefer other alternative commercial allocation mechanisms to commodity circulation allocation mechanisms—also stewarded  by the Commonwealth—they will make use of those mechanisms. 

The allocation mechanism does not make the socialism. Rather these allocation mechanisms are necessarily socialist allocation mechanisms (for example, socialist markets) because they are stewarded and administered by the Commonwealth so as to secure the rights of all and to maximize social welfare. 

> The system follows market socialism inspired by the People’s Republic of China, a system which lifted a billion people out of abject poverty. 

We can do much better than China (though China does have an impressive history of development). 

> It features non-profit, tax funded state control over essential sectors (energy, water, transport) as well as public-private for-profit State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). 

1. It would be a monumental tragedy to deny profits to workers just as they become the appropriators of the fruits of their own labors. The problem with capitalist profits is that they are extracted from the exploitation of workers. When we end exploitation, the pathologies associated with profits, interest, merchants, and so forth—these all end as well. 
1. Commonwealth control of the commanding heights of political economy is vital, but tax funded is undesirable except when positive externalities warrant it (as in Pigouvian subsidies—Pigou was a socialist—as well as Pigouvian fees for negative externalities: implying then that neither fee nor subsidy is warranted for the common resources of the commanding heights administered by the commonwealth, where those using such resources must assume due responsibility for their use of those resources). 
1. To achieve communism and socialism, we need to eliminate the State. The first step in the proletarian State is to smash the State. Public-private enterprises are a corruption peculiar to the capitalist mode of production. Like the wall of separation between government and religion we likewise need a wall of separation between the civic process of stewarding and administering the commanding heights common resources so as to maximize social welfare and secure the rights of all, on one hand, and on the other hand, the independent commercial and residential communes independently pursuing the social welfare of those independent collectives (however much that social welfare prioritizes profits or not). 

> The shares of these public-private SOEs …

Shares really serve no purpose in socialism/communism. It is really just retro nostalgia that seeks to retain shares.

> For public-private SOEs, the state acts like venture capital, setting them up with funding and direction. However, in the medium term, following an Initial Public Offering (IPO), these SOEs are expected to produce returns without government funding and compete efficiently against private organisations. 

Replace equity ownership of the corporate enterprise person (a relic of slavery as a corporate person owned is a corporate slave) with financing through lending. The lending can either be through the Common Credit Pool, administered by the commonwealth solely based on credit history and credit ratings,and/or lending from independent persons and entities that duly assess the prospects of their investment in an enterprise. Any person or other independent entity can even then borrow from the Common Credit Pool on their good credit m and then lend to enterprises based on their prospects for success.   

> There will be vast state 

A Commonwealth of a size requisite for the common needs. Smash the State and its repressive State apparatuses: bureaucracy, police, standing armies, unaccountable public officials with all too broad (un)qualified immunities. 

> This is in line with both Market Socialism and Keynsian Economics as state investment is essential to boosting spending, creating jobs and spurring growth. 

Investment in common resources should be queued—already planned, designed, and engineered—and then accelerated in market downturns, while slowed in boom times. This then dampens the market fluctuations in aggregate demand (due to a natural synchronization of depreciation and sinking fund cycles, and other similar phenomena). 

> One area of particular focus would be in research …

I have advocated for a civilian ARPA against the military DARPA. “Applied Research Projects Agency”. Open source software development, microchips, AI, Renewable Energy, green transportation technology, pharmaceutical and medical technology, commonwealth administration technology, and so forth. 

> Taxation Policy: 

Yours is too needlessly complicated and damaging to liberty. 

Pigouvian fees whenever warranted to cover only those subsidies warranted. All else through social cost reflecting user fees. 

To the extent Pigouvian fees prove insufficient to cover the Pigouvian subsidies, impose heavily graduated progressive income taxes on personal incomes (standard exemption on all income up to the median income) and similar heavily graduated (based on rate of profit rather than gross or net income) on worker coöperative commercial communist enterprises. These progressive enterprise taxes act as a Pigouvian fee on undesirable market hegemony and also a Just and proper tax on fortunate profit windfalls. If the Pigouvian fees exceed the Pigouvian subsidies simply add the excess to the common treasury —adding to the conking treasury of natural resource rent revenues—for equal distribution as an Unconditional Universal Basic Income (UUBI) social dividend (SD). 

> Capital Flight Policy:

Again needlessly complicated. Make all commercial enterprises into worker coöperative enterprises and then capital flight and immigration both evaporate as problems. 
 
> Immigration Restructuring: 

All of the immigration policy is meant to serve the ruling class in their oppression of the working class. Get rid of class antagonisms and we don’t need anything  else. We don’t need a fascist CBP or INS to dictate to the legislators what they demand to fulfill their fascist hatreds and bigotries against brown skinned immigrants.

 Allow immigrants to come to border entry points, register their entry just as we do for any one entering the jurisdiction through a birth canal or cesarian surgery and we’re all done. With the border entry, check with Interpol that the migrant is not a fugitive from Justice. If they are facilitate their extradition. Otherwise, if they are not a fugitive, then all is finished and they can enter the jurisdiction. 

 That’s enough from me for now. Perhaps I’ll tackle the rest later.",2024-12-07 03:49:32

I wanted it to be practicable, ie more than an idealistic goal roughly outlined as aspirations. Thus, the lengthy list of policies and systems.

>Hence like trans-technological-futurism is like a really bad idea IMO

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this, are you referrig to technocracy? If so, I'd be interested in hearing why you think it is inherently a bad idea.

>why do open borders matter?

For the same reason that the Manifesto insists on housing ethnic quotas, limited wealth redistribution, cracks down on nationalism and religion, and so on. The Objective section opens with the statement that the Oneness of the Human Race is at the core of my ideology, and that is entirely true. The entire system had in mind the goal of erasing arbitrary borders.

Do note the distinction between individuality and arbitrary divisions, something that often gets conflated. I seek to target that what divides us into tribal boxes, not what makes us Human.

>Why care about democratic norms in the first place? 

I discarded it initially, opting for a pure meritocracy. However, further research as well as debates with colleagues convinced me that the populace needs some outlet to voice their views. Additionally, it is crucial to have safegaurds against the Meritocracy becoming detached from the people it is to govern. A democratic body that coveys public sentiment, can review policy, as well as propose its own, and hold inept Council Members to account, I think can only help.

>Why does meritocracy become more important than other systems of deciding how technocratic societies can work?

Surely, meritocracy is synonymous with technocracy? I had assumed so at least. How can one pick the experts, if not by merit? If there are other systems or defintions please do let me know, I would be intersted to find out.

>The ideology has too many holes it in, logical holes, and there's not enough ""continuity"" connecting this as a philosophical alongside an ideological idea.

I'm afraid, I'm again not quite clear on what you meant by connecting it as a philosphical alongside the ideological. Surely, ideology is inextricably linked to philosophy? 

In any case, I would also like to hear your thoughts on what logical holes or contradictions exist in it, as I tried tomake it as coherent as it can be, and would like to iterate wherever I failed to do so.

>I just got my voter registration update in the mail today, it included my voter card as a perforated cardboard I.D. alongside my name and address, but also included a pre-paid postage to receive early voting.

>""John thought to himself, who would even pay for this? Who planned it, and why would I ever vote early?""

Arguably, in systems dominated by populism and demagogory, like modern western democracies, the votes of the intelligensia (which I assume make up this subreddit, as generally the 'average joe' doesn't spend their free time discussing political philosophy) would hardly count.

The way you keep a stable and safe society necessarily involves not screwing the common person over with too much.

The truth is people will put up with a lot of being screwed when society has certain benefits to keep them content.  The problem is that some people in power assume that because they push and don’t get actual backlash they can keep pushing and will never get backlash.  There is absolutely a breaking point, and we are nearing it in the US.  This reaction to the murder is just a symptom of that.

If there aren’t changes, things will continue to get worse and eventually this may look minor.  The reason Trump won despite being both evil and stupid is the common person just hates the status quo so much they want ANYTHING else.  They are willing to believe obvious lies because those lies are agreeing with them that the system is broken.

Unlike accelerationist, who are naive as hell and have no idea what they are wishing for, I desperately hope we can halt the progression of further getting fucked and start to turn it around, but I see things getting even worse in the short term so…No one knows what the breaking point is, and if they claim to do so they are lying, but it IS somewhere and we ARE getting uncomfortably close so accelerationists may very well get their way if the reaction to this reaction is “People sure are mean jerks that are evil” and not “Oh shit, a burst pipe spitting steam means we probably need to find and fix the problem before the entire thing explodes”",2024-12-07 08:24:03

I don't think ""murder is bad, actually"" is a particularly demanding moral position.


I'm not even asking for people to care about the victim or offer sympathy - I don't and no one is obliged to.


But I do think the bare minimum is not to ghoulishly revel in the public murder of a person, no matter how despicable, and to glaze up a person who shot and killed someone in cold blood.


People spend interminable hours online lecturing others on stochastic terrorism and speech as violence, but then they're too short-sighted and stupid to make the connection that, ""Hey, if I lionise and glorify a murderer for killing someone I didn't like, could that *maybe* incentivise future vigilantism against people I *do* like?""


When school shootings happen, experts advise the media to avoid focusing on and glorifying the shooter to avoid encouraging copycats.

Seems unlikely considering:

[A message left at the scene of a health insurance executive’s fatal shooting — “deny,” “defend” and “depose” — echoes a phrase commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims. The three words were written on the ammunition a masked gunman used to kill UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday. They’re similar to the phrase “delay, deny, defend” — the way some attorneys describe how insurers deny services and payment, and the title of a 2010 book that was highly critical of the industry.](https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-delay-deny-defend-depose-ee73ceb19f361835c654f04a3b88c50c)",2024-12-07 04:41:20

I get that some people have the gut reaction to dismiss everyone gleefully joking about his murder as edgy teenage leftists and going ""the internet isn't real life"" but I *genuinely* think that's a *relatively* more out-of-touch reaction than the people yelling ""kill the rich"" and googling ""how to construct guillotine"". From both the internet and real-life, the reaction I've overwhelmingly seen is ""celebratory"" with the common caveat that can best be summed up by that Clarence Darrow quote everyone and their mother has been posting: ""I have never killed anyone, but I have read some obituary notices with great satisfaction.""

The extent to which the reaction online differs from the broader adult population is a smaller-than-you-think gap between where each category's ""it's actually funny and good if this guy dies"" threshold is. I think some people aren't considering how many people there are that are *personally* put off by the idea of taking another human life, but are more than happy to see a very small number of certain people die -- usually people uniquely capable of causing mass suffering. Heads of state, CEOs, the ultrawealthy, etc.

If you put this guy in front of me with a loaded gun and a pre-written pardon, I wouldn't pull the trigger despite thinking he's an colossal piece-of-shit. But if you asked the average American to come up with a detailed ""volume of misery caused in America"" leaderboard, there'd be a *lot* of crossover. Among that crossover, many of them could die just like this CEO and elicit a very similar reaction, despite the fact that they haven't committed (or at least been convicted of) any crimes in our justice system.

Broader societal distrust and disdain for the elites running this country is relatively unfocused, however, meaning any change *at the ballot box* seems very unlikely because of disagreement over the specifics of what that'd even look like. Indeed, a growing lack of faith in our political institutions being able to address these issues is a big part of why people either resort to violence or abandon engaging with politics altogether. I don't think it's an ideal way to resolve immense inequality and suffering in this country, but it's hardly an online-only or edgy-teen-based phenomenon and it's not that hard to understand why things have been trending in this direction.

Our discussion of leftism has a serious weakness. It is still far from clear what we mean by the word ""leftist."" There doesn't seem to be much we can do about this. Today leftism is fragmented into a whole spectrum of activist movements. Yet not all activist movements are leftist, and some activist movements (e.g., radical environmentalism) seem to include both personalities of the leftist type and personalities of thoroughly un-leftist types who ought to know better than to collaborate with leftists. Varieties of leftists fade out gradually into varieties of non-leftists and we ourselves would often be hard-pressed to decide whether a given individual is or is not a leftist. To the extent that it is defined at all, our conception of leftism is defined by the discussion of it that we have given in this article, and we can only advise the reader to use his own judgment in deciding who is a leftist.

It also rather hypocritically struggles to fully define what a leftist is. As well as calls conservatives fools in another section.",2024-12-07 04:47:26

The expectation would be for Harris to win at least one of the swing states, and the fact she won zero of them was a surprise. 

Also, it’s worth noting that Trump won 3 million more votes in 2024 than in 2020, and 12 million more votes from 2020 to 2016, and his 2016 figures were 6 million more votes than Romney got in 2012",2024-12-07 12:17:27

In a modern sense it's a landslide since long gone are the days of one candidate winning the PV by 10-20 points and taking the majority of the electoral college. 

Personally I don't see it as a landslide, but I do see it as Harris getting her ass kicked pretty bad. She took Ls everywhere. She was unable to flip a single county, she lost traditional Democrat voting demographics and was not able to win not one swing state. Trump also took the fight to home turf and gave Harris some beatings in traditional blue states. He even when down to Harris's home state of California and flipped counties left and right.

So yeah not a knockout, but definitely a brutal beating. 

To be fair to Harris she  really was out there fighting to not get knocked out cold, not to actually win the fight. The fight was over before it started. Her goal was really just not lose that bad. So yeah Trump should had won an actual landslide election and he would, had Biden stayed in. But Harris put up a decent fight, specially since she had like what 3 months, to prepare and campaign? 

So to be fair to both sides. Trump gave Harris a brutal beating,  and there is no denying that, but taking into account she only had a handful of months to go out there and try and win the most powerful position on earth, she put up a hell of a fight. And Trump probably should have done better.",2024-12-07 10:41:41

It was featured in *Diamonds are Forever* (1971), the last of the great James Bond movies starring Sean Connery.

Here's my Circus Circus story.  The hotel is at the low end of Vegas accommodations, making it popular with families and others seeking a ""budget"" hotel.  I know some people at a small tech company which showed products at a Vegas trade show every year.  The President was a total cheapskate, so he booked rooms at Circus Circus for the staff going to the show.  At the end of one day, the President and the VP of Sales (who told the story) got into a cab.  The President said ""take us to Circus Circus"".  The cabbie turned and said ""huh — what asshole booked you there?""  VP of Sales had to do everything to keep from cracking up.",2024-12-06 23:27:57

The memory stays of that clown and his ways / He was giving his all and it led to his fall / Nobody knew of the pain that he cleverly hid / But there was never a wife and also never a kid 

He was living alone / in a wagon of wood / He was just a clown / Yet age got him good. / His hat was too small / His shoes too big and like lead / He was just a clown / But now he is dead 

The memory stays etc.

To be fair, this kind of general lookout over a specific period is definitely different from modeling more specific questions in general, but it was not a good performance (although I did nail some weirdly specific predictions, including my prediction on open source AI). I suppose I'll try again, but my usual caveats apply.

1.   US politics becomes sclerotic and messy to a scale that's unusual even for it (notably the House due to what may be the tiniest House majority in history and a likely incoming Speaker battle (I would have to double check to confirm, but I can't recall one smaller off the top of my head)).
2.  French politics also lands in the mire, yet again due to some underlying issues (essentially the right was expected to win, was stopped by the left, who were betrayed by Macron who they stopped the right for, and whose preferred PM was recently deposed by both the right and left).
3.  Mass deployment of humanoid robotics. With Unitree pricing units in the low tens of thousands, and more competition incoming imminently it's an industry geared up to begin scaling up rollout.
4.  Automation of R&D takes off. While to date there've been some efforts here (E.G. the automated materials science laboratory), they've been hampered by lack of mass application and availability. While reasoning does not entirely change that, it does mean there are some significant increases in who could apply it and to what.
5.  Ukraine is a mess. With an incoming US president who opposes concessions to Ukraine, and a Ukraine unwilling to surrender while it's unclear what the result will be, it's unlikely to be clean.
6.  Gaza remains a secondary focus, but Israel continues to be embroiled in conflict (as we've seen here there are a lot of areas where either active or potential breakouts can occur, but it seems to have moved beyond that as the central focus of the violence - albeit I'm not sure what it looks like the long run). So far escalation has been avoided, and I do think that's more likely than not to continue. 
7.  Recession. I thought it was slightly more likely to be this year (which appears improbable now), but I would actually start to head towards surprised if it didn't begin the incoming year (if it didn't hit by the next I would be outright shocked).
8.  Breadth in AI. One thing that parallels adoption and competition new tech spaces is it essentially spreading out. You can see it with the internet, smart phone apps, streaming, etc. The early uses frequently look nothing like the long term ones, and I think we'll start to see the beginning of that complexity.
9.  Tariffs won't be implemented on the scales discussed, but still cause problems.
10.  Violence. We've seen the beginnings of something unusual in America with the attacks on a healthcare CEO, and I think this is just one expression of a potential broader trend (and not even the only one so far).
11. Immigration and migration issues. We saw this during Trump's first term, but more so now as things like climate refuges have began and global instability has risen, I think we're going to see both domestic and international issues with people who lack a stable home.
12.  Homelessness, or more specifically (since that's already extant), policies that worsen and target it - we've already seen some of this, but it's also become a big touch stone of the culture war.
13.  Conservatives win the Canadian election.
14.  Democrats outperform in special and off year elections (in the US).
15. AI investment has it both ways (with both increased use/dominance/investment for some major use cases, but companies outside those areas see some major failures).

This is a mess, and even more 'train of thought' than my usual predictions in these.",2024-12-07 01:38:16

Fundamentally, Libertarians want freedom. They don't particularly want freedom to oppress other people, but that turns into an unresolve issue for them.

Greens also want freedom, but Greens want planning for our collective survival more. We talk like majorities should have the right to coerce minorities when the majorities are right and our collective survival depends on it. 

These are issues which could perhaps be resolved sufficiently.

If we could find truly democratic ways to select candidates who are acceptable to Greens and Libertarians both, those candidates might get farther toward winning elections than cadidates who appeal only to one. Winning elections and accomplishing *something* is better than just losing.

""You can't win running third party."" In other words, everyone who thought the Green Party platform made sense but didn't vote for them did so because they perceived that other Americans wouldn't vote Green, either.

Beyonce grew up with money too.  She went to private school, her parents had a nice house, cars, housekeepers, etc. Her parents had her set up with talent agencies since she was 8 years old.

1h8bjv5,The Problems with Predictions,https://www.reddit.com/r/Experiencers/comments/1h8bjv5/the_problems_with_predictions/,43,MantisAwakening,2024-12-06 20:57:39,False,9,m0s7nah,KefkaFFVI,12,"So I'm partly embarrassed to share this but felt compelled to so why not, but basically all of this started to kick off around 2020/2021, it was practically my awakening process. I already had a big interest in near death experiences and closely related phenomenon and looking into the hard problem of consciousness but nothing outside of that. I had also one shared experience relating to a friend that had passed on with my other ""living"" friend there to verify that event happened. AFTER my below ""awakening"" event was where I had a dramatic uptick in crazy events happening to me, spiritual encounters, pre-cognitive dreams, synchronicities etc. 

Below this paragraph I'll provide abit more wider context surrounding this as it's quite vague and very symbolic, but the gist of some of the collective worldwide themes that were being sent to me are; These visions started from a divine feminine being saying ""allow me to create heaven on earth"" - I saw this as her telling me by going into flow state and allowing the visions to come through she was going to help me to heal my wounds and connect to life purpose (I felt very lost and depressed as this started), but I guess that can also apply to the divine feminine on a collective level. I had words such as the watchers being sent to me and references to the creation of the new earth. A ton of re-occuring symbolism relating to Butterflies, Deer, Owls, Eagle/Hawk, Spider and Mantis (the Mantis is the one I feel most connected to, always felt Alien - later realised people have a ton of contact experiences relating to Mantis beings which amazed me as I'd not heard of those beforehand). There was a reference to Anima specifically (a Jungian term, no mention of Animus though) and how confrontation with Anima was going to awaken the unconscious sleeping masses https://chatgpt.com/share/675396ec-bd68-8006-bce0-f4a8df593af7 I believe Anima also means soul, so soul re-connection. I was shown that there would be mass UFO disclosure related to this (had no idea about the rising cases of this year's ago as I was recieving all of this). I was shown symbolism of the flood - classic Noahs Ark style but with UFOs helping to transport people to a higher dimensional reality. I was shown that the powers of the world would try and paint the UFO phenomenon as being something that is evil in their attempt to keep people asleep. I was shown there would be a mass depression/traumatised people but also revolutions & mass healing taking place, and more emphasis on self-empowerment and connecting to people's own inner guidance. This also related to the act of purification (alchemical reference) as well as more people becoming individuated (Jung). Then the story ends on the creation of new earth, where we are all co-creators of our own reality and connected to eachother in ways the human species hasn't been before - like a complete 180 from asleep masses to awakened spiritually tapped in beings. 

And to provide a summary; a few years ago I started recieving a flurry of visions daily that completely overwhelmed me, as well as stream of consciousness automatic writing where I was being streamed information that was coming from beyond my conscious awareness - I had no say in what was  coming through and it was completely effortless, with a ton of personal meaning to me, and the whole experience was very healing for me. Nothing like this had ever happened to me before and because of that I also felt like I was going insane (but like in a good way - it was completely energising and felt like I was connecting to my core self at a very deep level). Around this time I felt like I was also being guided & encouraged to start my own brand and to pursue my passions. I plan to create the channelled story over the course of 22 animations (self-taught, related to my passions I was pursuing) and the story will unfold overtime.

I had an insane amount of synchronicities occurring as I was being fed all of this information and guidance. It didn't feel like I was the one who was creating all of this, the visions were being rapid fired at me, the majority of the time whilst I was in the shower and then I'd need to hurry up and finish my shower to write everything down because of how loaded with information these visions were being sent to me (also stressful lol, for atleast a period of 1-2 years I couldn't have a relaxing shower for this reason). 

Its also worth noting that the story that was being sent to me of what I should create was like a giant jigsaw where the story was already formed and I was just being sent multiple pieces at a time with visions coming rapidly one after the other after the first one had been sent. They were highly symbolic with a ton of references to Spiritual Alchemy, Hermeticism, Jung and the Heroes Journey, all of which I had absolutely 0 knowledge of beforehand (you can imagine how creeped out I was afterwards as I started to discover these things and seeing all the symbolic imagery that I seemed to be channelling, as well as words which I later came to learn about that I didn't know the meanings of). 

If you'd have asked me before all this that I was going to write a compelling 150k words story with a ton of plot twists with some insane visuals I'd of laughed at you because I had absolutely 0 interest in creating a story and I had no idea how to. After I was fed all of the puzzle pieces through visions the story perfectly clicked into place, including many paradigm shifting plot twists which expanded my view of what the story was even about in ways that blew my mind. I was completely in the dark about all this and just writing everything down that I was seeing.

Before all of this I was also deeply traumatised & dissociated/disconnected from myself - this whole experience was life changing for me. It was showing me aspects of myself that I had suppressed, how my parents had an impact on me in ways conscious me didn't even realise, and there was a being in these visions that was embodying these different characters in my story and showing me all the fractured parts of myself and helping to heal them. Very neon genesis evangelion style if anyone has watched that. I later realised once I started looking into Jung that this guide figure is incredibly common and it was basically like my own version of Hermes which is said to be the messenger of the Gods and helps to show people things as they explore their unconscious world https://chatgpt.com/share/67539889-6cf0-8006-a9c1-2bad69e9bad0 And that what seemed to be happening to me was what Jung himself described as active imagination & individuation - ""meeting with my soul"". I practically now have my own red book like Jung himself wrote with his ""encounters with the unconscious"" as he called this process. After discovering Jung I felt such a massive sigh of relief as he was perfectly describing what I was going through, it was pretty mind blowing to me learning about him after all this. 

A lot of the themes that were being sent to me I later realised we're actually things that others were reporting too on a collective level, it was like a crazy mix of this guide being showing me what had happened over my life, and showing me (what I believed) was going to happen collectively, but I guess in a very symbolic way, but potentially some of those things beings quite literal too. Again as I was recieving all of these visuals I had absolutely 0 knowing of the state of disclosure and how it was going to be ramping up shortly after, I also didn't have as much interest in UFOs as I do now - now I'm fully engaged and stay up to date with this, also practicing CE-5.",2024-12-06 22:55:37

Also they are outside space and time, trying to make predictions (or trick us) on things that haven’t happened yet, because the things that happen depend on our (human) actions.

If something hasn’t happened yet, it is no different than all possibilities existing in the quantum, and maybe our individual and collective experience and choices determine what happens in this collective world?

I've been fascinated with the occult/aliens/reincarnation/all things unknown since childhood. I did a few deep dives into reading about Catholic eschatology (near Y2K) and Mayan astronomy (around 2010-12). While I've had several dreams/premonitions about future events related to my own life that came true, I can count on one hand the number of times I've 'successfully' predicted a world event. And even in those cases, the ""success"" was only really in hindsight - I've never received actionable information to predict (or prevent) a future world catastrophe.

In all my recent meditations, I receive messages on trends but have never received any specific predictions...except one time. Earlier last month, I meditated on the outcome to a specific event. I saw a map & an infographic with the results of this event, and even heard specific numbers related to the event. Since this was the outcome I desperately wanted, I went to bed happy...only to wake up reading news that the EXACT OPPOSITE outcome happened. After coming to terms with incredible disappointment, I realized I am not at all a clear channel for this kind of thing. I let my emotions & expectations dictate what I saw & heard. Considering I can't even predict what I'll eat for dinner tomorrow - a situation that is 100% within my own control - how the hell would I ever predict a future world event in which numerous souls with free will might have a say?

Still, I'm naturally curious about predictions. However, I've also noticed a trend: the times in my life when I had an extreme amount of uncertainty (be it personal, financial, mental, whatever) were the times I gravitated most towards predictions/prophecies/fortune telling, conspiracies, and some deep new age rabbit holes. What's more, I gravitated towards those predictions & conspiracies that mirrored my emotional state. I wanted so much to be prepared at times in life when I felt everything was spinning beyond my control - not just for my own protection, but for my loved ones as well.

So if you're noticing yourself doing something similar lately (and yes, there's plenty of uncertainty to go around), maybe step back for a moment and reflect on what is driving your interest. Don't underestimate how much personal turmoil and obsessive internet doom-scrolling can prime a person to be more receptive to bullshit (to put it bluntly). None of us is immune to this.

Do you want to know the future in order to react to it, because someone else (billionaires, aliens/NHIs, the gov't, whoever) is running the show? Or do you want to become a co-creator of the kind of future in which you & your loved ones will thrive? Because the first option is dependent on *someone else* being in charge of *your* future. So if you're feeling anxious about that idea, maybe log off for a short time and visualize what a happy future would like like from your POV. Not just the nice things that could exist, but how our own way of accepting & interacting with reality might change for the better. :)",2024-12-07 03:59:17

I feel 1000% more connected to myself than I did before all of this happened. The individuation process has helped me to feel whole again, I feel like I've balanced the ""divine masculine & feminine"" energies inside myself which were at each others throats before this (also which I've learned recently is known as coniunctio in spiritual alchemy).  Theres a ton of stuff I left out but I'd be here all day going over all the synchronistic events relating to these visions I was getting, and alot of them I've likely forgotten about because there was so many over the past few years.

Interesting. I've had a similar kind of experience, starting around 2016, but involving music.

Basically, about ten years earlier, I had started trying to make digital mixtapes, a process I enjoyed, but always found my themes centered around apocalypses, and the mix I created was a downer. I was also trying to write science fiction but constantly found myself with writer's block.

Around 2014 I was collecting 1980s music on Youtube and getting inspired by rediscovering music I'd known briefly as a kid. But I still had that downer apocalypse vibe.

In late 2015 I was on a UFO-related forum (the Townsend Brown research community) and was getting creeped out by the conspiracy tone. In a sort of act of desperation, I made a mixtape of all the music I knew that that felt ""uplifting"" and was also linked to the UFO subject. This included the Carpenters cover of ""Calling Occupants"", which I was aware was a very literal invocation to NHI, and had always scared me for that reason. But I felt internally I was at a crossroads and was willing to open myself to the reality of the phenomenon and trust that it was positive.

What resulted was a similar sense of something in my unconscious mind guiding me in surprising ways. My '80s music project turned into a trilogy of very focused science fiction stories which played with and inverted the idea of apocalypse. They were filled with a brightness and hope that I hadn't had in my work before. And whatever my unseen muse was, it didn't stop there. I ended up scripting a whole series of related mixtapes, all building on and developing my fictional story. There were deep connection and resonances of the kind that I couldn't plan consciously. There's a plot that, if I ever write a novel, I could draw on. And I can listen to this music whenever I need to, to recenter and brighten my mood when I'm feeling bleak. The process itself was fun: a little scary at times, because I would feel an urgency to make a mixtape, starting with a couple of songs I'd found, and have no idea how they would connect or even why there was any sense of a ""time limit"". But always something would come together. There was something in my unconscious mind that seemed to remember my childhood music memories better than I did myself. 

The process was also deeply healing and educational: I found myself learning the stories and connections behind music I'd heard once but never understood the context behind. The sheer breadth of the music I located, that all seemed to have some kind of energetic ""glow"" to it, made me feel less alone in the universe. The act of collating a music database also gave me some complex inter-related material to experiment with in a database search programming project.

Also, during this process, I found myself drawn to Jewish Kabbalah and the idea of the divine masculine/feminine balance, which seemed to connect a whole bunch of religious and philosophical ideas that I'd never before thought were linked.

And the symbol of the UFO kept constantly reoccurring throughout my explorations. Partly because I'd started there, but also I think because pop music in the 20th century has been haunted by the UFO mystery, as has everything else. Another recurring symbol was society / the physical world as a simulation, and of the deep and pressing need to ""awake"" from this.

I also knew that I wasn't completely consciously ""making something happen"". I would actually drag my feet about creating a mixtape: songs would cross my path, and I'd go ""yeah, that could work, but I don't want to open this channel again right now..."" and then another couple would appear and suddenly I'd be ""no, I have to do this one, this is just too beautiful not to make"". Mostly, a tape would form itself fairly easily, but there were a couple of times when I had to backtrack. Once, early on, I had a less than satisfying result and then the song I was using (on Youtube - yes I know, it's like doing sculpture in the medium of sandcastles on a beach, but that was the deal) went offline, so I looked for replacements, which were much better. Another time, I pushed a little too hard to ""get the mix done"" and it just wasn't energetically right, it was depressing. I unravelled it and what came, the next time, when I waited for the right inspiration, was both much better and there was also much more of it. And there were always unexpected musical resonances and twists in the storyline that filled me with pure joy. 

So yeah. I have no idea what exactly it was that I opened myself up to... but it was purposeful, positive, willing to work with my rational mind and not against it, and just nice to be around. And it also felt like it was ""me"" and not ""alien to me"", but a side of me I hadn't been aware existed. Rather, it was like all the memories I'd forgotten were not actually lost; just temporarily mislaid by me, but like some kind of ""assistant"" was able to locate them and point them out, where they'd fit in a big mosaic.

I suspect a lot of people encounting an unexpected creative process have this experience, but for me it was quite startling. And why UFOs? Why this symbol? I guess just because it was there, in front of me, and I couldn't honestly avoid it? I still don't even know that I believe, with my conscious, rational mind, that UFOs are real. But my unconscious mind seems to.

>I practically now have my own red book like Jung himself wrote with his ""encounters with the unconscious"" as he called this process. 

Yes, I think that's a good summary of what this kind of experience is like.",2024-12-07 05:47:19

It's like with music, you can try to be a singer and do all the right strategizing, but if you aren't a talented singer or songwriter then I mean you're not going to do much.

Testimony is presumed to be truthful in asylum hearings unless there is reason to doubt it. You want a good lawyer (not consultant) who can help you get ahead of any evidence deficiencies, but support letters from family etc also help. 

If you don't currently have any assets or income your first step is to contact Legal Aid Ontario and seek a certificate to file your refugee claim. The lawyer will help you fill out your paperwork and then get authorization to help you at your hearing. 

If you got a visa to Canada it will also be a good idea to file an access to information request for your visa application so you can explain any potential inconsistencies well in advance. 

Given clear country evidence of political repression the most important issue is not going to be whether you were targeted in the past but whether you hold genuine anti government beliefs that would subject you to persecution if you attempted to express them in Myanmar. To that end it doesn't hurt to continue to be politically active in the diaspora (if you're not worried that doing so would cause your family to be targeted).

You will likely have to explain why you returned to Myanmar from Thailand instead of trying to seek protection there.",2024-12-06 20:46:59

You wouldn't know that from how our media reports it, but the bleak comes in a mixed bag on this one.

Heller, the 2^(nd) Amendment reads ""~~A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,~~ the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Before 2008, there was no strikethrough and courts based their rulings on the whole sentence. The Amendment was taken to more or less mean that congress couldn't regulate away to a state's right to maintain a militia, though I don't think absolutist readings (either for or against the individual right to bear arms) were common.

Well, yeah, it was made up by a bunch of rich white guys to defend the interests of other rich white guys and their friends. The founding fathers only had to consider the thoughts of land-owning white men, because in most states, those were the only ones that could vote or have any political power at all. The 2nd amendment was for the purposes of conscription of the general public and for slave owners to protect themselves from potential revolt by their slaves, not some grand purpose of stopping tyrannical oppression. Tyrannical oppression comes from the state and military power, and even back then, an actual military unit is a lot more capable and prepared than some town of farmers.",2024-12-07 09:45:02

If that “document” bothers you, go find a country that doesn’t rely on an old document. Castles have not be a defense tool in hundreds of years, there have never been castle used in the United States. Perhaps a simple history class would help explain that further.

For the consumer, universal healthcare is not that much different than having medical insurance. It comes out of your paycheck anyway. But instead of paying an insurance company, the same money goes to public healthcare. As long as you don't need healthcare, the premium paid by your employer will go to shareholders or **will be paying for other peoples healthcare.** So you are still paying for other peoples healthcare.   

There are two main differences though:   
1. Since there aren't any shareholders to pay, everything goes towards healthcare.
2. Way less bullshit, like denied coverage, out of network whatever, or a hefty out of pocket.   

Since there aren't any shareholders to pay, you still have a right to healthcare even if you are in a tough spot without a job. Because as a human being you should have the right to healthcare.",2024-12-07 08:20:54

I've heard people surprised by the fact that any veteran would or could be disillusioned with THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH™ or the incoming dear leader and so I am obligated to speak up and speak out. 

For the most part, I feel that military support in the US is a hollow gesture. If the country really supported us we would get better healthcare from the VA and the country wouldn't be so gung ho about going to war. It's fitting that so many of the yellow ribbons I see are car magnets because that support is so easily removed once it becomes inconvenient or just entirely forgotten about once it's no longer in sight.

Politicians mostly only care about us as part of the ""USA! USA! USA!"" bullshit. We're propped up as things for the masses rally behind but politicians would prefer it if we'd just died overseas, both so that they wouldn't have to pay to fix us when we broke and so that they can use our flag draped caskets as props in photo ops showing their voters how sad and patriotic they are.

The part that screws me up is the paradox of not being American and thus not benefiting. 

Let's say that Trump does in fact make America objectively better. He improves the economy. If you're American, Trump supporter or not, you'd benefit from that (in this hypothetical). A Canadian wouldn't. A strong America means our dollars don't go as far and we end up paying more. 

So if I'm purely motivated by self interest (as basically all Trumpists are)... that's even MORE damaging to my Canadian self interests.

If anything they're too good an inspiration. If we Dutch people want to fix racism we just look at exactly what you're doing and copy that without even considering the different context. You're that awesome of an example.

I love to harp on your country Americans, don't get me wrong. I still remember all the great jokes we made about George W. Bush and his silly cowboy hat, about Arnold Schwarzenegger getting elected on the back of yelling oneliners while jumping out of a helicopter, Sarah Palin having foreign policy experience because you can see Russia from Alaska. Remember those people? Gosh, they were absolutely amazing in comparison to what we now know was the realistic alternative. Schwarzenegger in particular just turned out to be a serious guy doing serious things. I owe that man an apology. But at the end of the day there is also still just a lot we do like about the US and things you can like about it. It's still a country of extremes, but that includes good extremes.

I don't live in any of those areas, so my chances are low, but you're greatly exaggerating the amount of people who are attacked.

--

>According to a study of roughly 400 human-cougar encounters over the last four decades, about 4 to 6 cougar (aka mountain lion) attacks happen across the U.S. and Canada each year. And most attack victims survive.

--

>The FWC has kept a record of “unprovoked bite incidents” since 1948 and reports that, between then and November 2021, there were only 442 alligator attacks. Only 26 of those resulted in human fatalities. 

--

>[For brown bears] We recorded an attack rate of 39.6 attacks/year globally: 11.4 attacks/year in North America and 18.2 attacks/year in Europe (10 attacks/year, if we exclude Romania)[so it actually happens more in Europe LMAO]

--

>According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, there haven't been any documented gray wolf attacks in the lower 48 states


Raddle snakes is the only one relatively high, but fatalities are few and far between because of the availability of antivenom. They literally warn you to get away, most of the time it's because people fuck with them. 

>Rattlesnakes usually avoid humans, but about 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States each year, with 10 to 15 deaths, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Brown recluse usually bite a few thousand each year, but that happens inside almost exclusively, and people rarly die from that.

Can't really think of many others. Sometimes whitetail deer can fuck someone up, but you *really* have to be asking for it. Maybe a buffalo, but they don't attack unprovoked. 

Whatever preconceived notions you have of the US being dangerous to traverse because of the wildlife, you're sadly mistaken.

The anti Maga, pro democracy, women's rights crowd known as The Left has no unifying cause that I can see.  Harris was on the right track with her ""We won't go back"" slogan but it was only a start.

I've seen posts about organizing a general strike.  Okay, a strike against what??  The fact that Trump won a fair and free election?  That he's going to enact P2025 and do all of the other things that so many of us tried to warn our friends and family about?  When countries who really have the art of protesting down (looking at several European nations) they are in the streets for a purpose.  Get rid of that, reinstate this, a single cause that may have many other components mixed in but can still be summed up with a few concentrated demands.

The left in America doesn't have that.  There are a LOT of good causes and many reasons to protest but I fear that too many different demands at the same time cancel each other out.  It just becomes static and easily brushed aside as another special interest trying to get attention.

I don't have the answer but I am hoping that sometime soon, before the full weight of what we are about to experience under Trump comes to bear, that we can get our collective shit together and find a common goal to rally around.

Edit:  I want to clarify that this isn't just about a cause for protest but as an actionable goal.  Something that we can use to guide us going forward in our schools, communities, and government. A unified front not only against Maga but also for the advancement of the Left agenda, whatever it may be.",2024-12-06 21:06:17

Like at a pride parade bringing a Palestinian flag is probably the best example.

It’s not uncommon for cops to pocket the money. There’s forums discussing these things on how to encourage cops to sell their weapons.

The Biden admin is investigating this and instituted reform by the ATF to track down (simply track) where all the retired weapons by law enforcement are going. Why? Because of lot of these guns are ending up in gang  and cartel violence, shootouts, mafias, and even trafficked internationally.

I’m guessing Kash Patel is willing to repeal that.

Lots of non-profit healthcare organization have done well, historically, and are doing well now, I believe. So my way around these issues is to find out whatever an organization like Healthpartners is doing, and then do something like that. No need to get snappy.

I think the problem you are getting at is that if health insurance providers can choose who they accept as clients, there is a natural race to the bottom in terms of just selecting the 'best' clients and leaving higher risk people underserved at higher prices. In that environment, both cooperatives and private insurers can survive and flourish equally. But if a cooperative does want to be a force for good, it may in fact find itself losing money.

So that's an underlying structural issue, that would probably best be remedied by government. But it doesn't mean that health cooperatives are impossible, nor that they wouldn't be better. All things considered a well-organized public system does seem to be the better way of doing it - most rich countries seem to go for some variant on public health instead of mass mutualization of health insurance.

From some angles that's a feature, from other's it's a bug. With consumer cooperatives the company is running at cost and operating under at different set of values, but at the same time there are lots of similarity to whatever normal business.

If you look at REI, for example, I think a lot of people do just think it's a normal company. I think REI's workers do tend to be paid better than equivalent non-cooperative businesses, but they have also had labour issues lately.

So instead you could try and organize the economy such that no matter what you do in life you get a salary. That has issues of its own though.",2024-12-06 22:37:52

I'm not always 100% impressed with how consumer cooperatives are run. In the business literature there's something called the 'Agent-principal problem' - we consumers are the 'principal', the owners of the company who hire 'agents' to run the company. The agents are the board of directors, who hire the CEO and whoever, who hire other employees etc.

So what can happen is the owners of the company just don't really care about anything - they are  busy, so they don't put a lot of effort into figuring out who to elect for the board of directors.

We have a term for that... *wage-slavery*. It is our need for resources which others have determined theirs (owners) that must be exchanged for money, if survival compels us to sell labor then it really isn't a choice now. Very few co-ops legitimately owned by the workers instead of ""shares"" while actual ownership is placed in minority hands, plus REI still operates within a capitalist system.

The state can also provide a guaranteed income alongside free markets, so you don't have to work to survive, but it gets you extra nice stuff. That's all getting beyond the scope of this post. 

Lots of worker owned cooperatives do seem to end up having different classes of ownership. But with a worker's co-op that is equally owned this isn't 'wage slavery', although it is slavery to the market - you only get paid if your company is successful. So in the end it kind of works out the same in some ways, different in others.

REI or credit unions or the Green Bay Packers are different, they are consumer-owned cooperatives. And in some ways they have the same incentives as rich owners making a profits - your REI backpack is marginally cheaper if you exploit your workers, just like a corporation makes more money for shareholders if they exploit their workers.

Unfortunately in highschool, people are immature and might not be the best or most humble winners. It would have been the same way if Kamala won. Our country is hurting. The identity politics have fractured our communities even more. He never said he would do away with naturalization, but he has said he will deport massive amounts of illegal immigrants. He ran heavily on that and people voted for it. If you’re legal, you have nothing to worry about. When there were only a few hundred people coming across the border, people complained but they weren’t motivated to demand a change from government. Now that 10-15 thousand have been coming across every day, people have had enough. And they deserve to feel that way. There are some good people that are going to have to go home, but you can’t just break into another country and think it’s ok. It’s not ok almost everywhere else in the world. It’s not ok here either. When people come across illegally, get free housing, free healthcare, free food, yet Americans devastated after a natural disaster get a $750 check, it’s probably going to stir people to action. Most people that voted for Trump don’t hate Mexicans or any Latino peoples, they do pay taxes and they are tired. Don’t be afraid.

Yeah, I have been barking up that tree since before the covid scam.  The problem is not with 'journalism' so much as the media outlets have been bought-and-paid-for as the propaganda megaphone for the sociopaths and their narrative.  There was a lot of hype a while back after a woman on a network news show quit on the air, stating that the news was all heavily scripted bullshit and they were no longer allowed to report on real news.

With that out of the way, yes indeed there is a deliberate agenda at play to attack and undermine western religious institutions.  Of course the news is filled with stories of anti-semiticism and islamaphobia to highlight every perceived aggression against other faiths, but outrageous acts of violence against Christians or attacks on churches are largely ignored.  This goes right in line with how even the most benign perceived insults against POC are presented as systemic racism, but when POC violently attack white people (often while screaming vile racist statements) it is either ignored or distorted as a reprisal against racism.  LOL they twist themselves into knots to gaslight people into believing lies while furiously covering up the truth.

Stand back from the agenda of disinformation and there are very encouraging examples of courageous individuals that denounce ALL of it and stand up for what is right.  Most people are good people and would never dream to disrespect a church, a mosque or a synagogue.  Most people are respectful to individuals of other faiths and welcome learning about other cultures.  It is only a tiny fraction of sociopaths that are intent on creating division and fomenting violence.  Rather than play along with this programming, more of us need to stand up and denounce it for what it is.",2024-12-06 18:37:49

Sure, we've done some stupid things, but by far we are a great and decent democracy that strives to be better.   We don't deserve to see our founding religions, Catholic and Protestant Christianity, derided to the point that our historic churches are burned to the ground.

I blame in large part the doctrine of the Liberal Party that has tried to destroy our history and socially engineer a false culture that nobody asked for.   The clapping seals in the Press were happy to support it all.

The church burnings started after the mass graves thing.  The thing here is: 

To this date - 3 years later - we have zero evidence of any mass graves 

But potentially worse is that we didn’t have any evidence in 2021, when for example the NYT ran a story condemning Residential School, or whenOttawa flew the flag at half mast for 6 FUCKING MONTHS without zero evidence that even one mass grave exists 

Fun fact, Trudeau did ofc condemn the church burnings and vandalism but in the very next sentence called them “understandable” 

This is the real story here: that the federal government, countless big media outlets, and a significant number of Canadians immediately accepted a story as true without having any actual evidence other than some “irregular soil readings” and a number of FNs basically saying “trust me bro”

The mass graves hoax is a truly Orwellian moment in Canadian history, that’s the real tragedy here, and the fact that even today many believe this story, suggests that there’s a huge danger here, probably significantly more dangerous than anti Christian bigotry.",2024-12-07 01:47:49

Eisenhower was a moderate even centrist politician. I believe both Democrats and Republicans courted him and he went with the Republicans because that was the easiest pathway to getting the nomination. 

The Republican Party campaigned as being a pro-Union, pro-existing welfare state(no expansion) and on being much more hawkish against the Soviets. Eisenhower being a general during WWII was the perfect candidate for this platform. 

Their rhetoric was pretty harsh accusing Democrats of ""Squandering the post war peace""

https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1952

Their first point is just a blistering attack on Truman's foreign policy. Blaming the Democrats for everything under the sun, and painting a picture of a strong and growing evil Soviet Union and a weak United States. 

In the foreign policy statement they make it clear they are also in favor of free trade with other nations as a way of executing US soft power. They accuse Truman of appeasement to communists and claim that communists have infiltrated the US government. Accuse the Democrats of having communist members. While asserting that not a single Republican is a communist. 

They go on to make it extremely clear they support unions and lay out what rights a worker should have.

They promise to continue FDR style public work projects and to be good stewards of the environment. 

The biggest set of disagreements the Republicans seem to have is on foreign policy and national defense. They promise basically continue FDR/Truman's labor and welfare but just be more efficient less corrupt and better at administering it. 

It's extremely interesting to look back at the policies and state of the political parties back then.

So I started watching the parliamentary debates and CPAC in the US. Wow! What an eye opener. 
Not only will I never consider myself a liberal again, but I will never trust another headline until I dive deeper into it and understand the whole picture for myself. News today is just someone opinion at best. 

Probably the most disgusting news article I ever read was from the CBC when our government was passing the MAiD legislation. Now my bias is that I don’t believe anyone should end their life for mental illness… that said, the ONLY criticism of MAiD that the author discussed was that “some critics” were concerned that remote indigenous communities would not have immediate access to MAiD clinics. 
I found that so unlikely… like why would these so called critics want MAiD access for remote indigenous communities so bad? Is a car/bus ride too much to ask of some one who is choosing ending their life? 
So I looked for these “some critics” because they must really have something out for these communities… I could find absolutely nothing to support the claim. In fact what I found was quite the opposite. Many indigenous leaders were strongly opposed to the bill, and felt that MAiD would negatively impact their communities. I then had to wrestle with the motive behind a network that self proclaims to be all for indigenous rights, advocating for these communities to have access to a life ending treatment they don’t want. 
It just sickened me.

I was fine with Obama, and was devoutly against Trump winning, it was easy to make those jokes that he had no chance. I thought he was racist and all that.

Then I looked into Right wing media (not mainstream) and I quickly realized, the best commentators are the ones who still criticize and admit Trump isn’t great, they don’t just lap up everything he says, they criticize the left more for sure, but it’s not like they hold Trump up as the saviour. Which is why I feel stuff like QAnon and Flat Earthers are actually being propped up by the left just to point the finger and laugh and make onlookers think they don’t want to associate with any of those people.

And then I read Clinton accepted the DNC nomination there? Oh wait, they are just ascribing the 1939 stuff to Trump because they can, not because it has any actual relevance, but hey let’s just say it a bunch and surely some people will listen! It got dropped in a day and it switched to Tony Hinchcliffe’s comment about the floating pile of garbage, Puerto Rico. And David Muir (the guy from the debate?!) even says “Oh we can’t share that, it’s too offensive” meanwhile not seconds after the crowd did NOT laugh, and even lead Tony to be like “woah, okay you didn’t like that one” meanwhile, it actually bares relevance since Puerto Rico has a garbage problem.

""The tariff rate will go up to 100% on electric vehicles, to 50% on solar cells and to 25% on electrical vehicle batteries, critical minerals, steel, aluminum, face masks and ship-to-shore cranes beginning September 27, according to the US Trade Representative’s Office.

""Tariff hikes on other products, including semiconductor chips, are set to take effect over the next two years.

""The administration’s increases – which impact a relatively small amount of US imports – come as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have clashed over tariffs on the campaign trail. Trump is calling for sweeping new duties on all imports, while Harris has said that his proposal would raise prices on American households.

""Trump implemented sweeping tariffs on about $300 billion of Chinese-made products when he was in office. President Joe Biden has kept those tariffs in place and, after the USTR finished a multiyear review earlier this year, decided to increase some of the rates on about $15 billion of Chinese imports.""

Putting blanket tariffs on all products is the epitome of stupidity because, do we have companies or factories step up here to replace the products that will now have tariffs? The answer is no which signals the key difference between Trump's tariffs and Biden's tariffs. One is brainless, the other has a purpose.

Additionally, revoking all the tariffs Trump put in place makes the US look weak and a bad business partner. Who wants to do business with a country who's changing their mind every four years.

>Thus overall, if the election data we have truly is valid, then this is implying that absolutely no new Democrats showed up to vote during the 2024 Election in a region that is primarily dominated by Democrats.

You know that's not true, right? You're telling me a person who was 16 years old in 2020, who is bright, well-educated, with a solid set of role models - did not vote in 2024 when they had the capability? The polls show that democratic votes went down. That can mean that people didn't show up/vote top ticket OR it can mean they switched the other side OR it can mean they voted 3rd party. The way it frequently works in this country is that we don't all fall into two bins. Something about candidate A pisses me off so I switch to candidate B even though they are the scum of the Earth. It is weird and the not the way I personally operate, but it happens. 

  
Look, I think the numbers are weird, but this isn't it. Bullet ballots get you closer, but can still be explained. The absence of a democratic county switch is perhaps the most interesting, but still has occurred in the 1930s (I would need to fact check the exact election). If you look in the details - that's where you will find the real anomalies. The ""statistically-this-is-not-possible"" ideas. That's what we need.

Harris’ support was manufactured. Despite what you may have seen online or among your friend group, polling didn’t once show that this was going to be a landslide election in her favor. 

Historically unpopular incumbent president, historically unpopular incumbent vice president, no real primary, negative public perception on the economy & immigration, *ALL* incumbents losing worldwide, and the list could go on. If you thought she was going to win, you weren’t paying attention. 

Democrats were obviously not enthused about an establishment candidate (who they didn’t nominate) who openly exclaimed she would do nothing different from the incredibly unpopular Biden administration. On top of this, Trump was leaning into the issues that consistently polled at the top of mind for likely voters: the economy & immigration. He utilized social media in a way Harris avoided (podcasts, memes, Twitter/X, TikTok) and really reached out to an up and coming demographic that Democrats have alienated: young men. 

I live in a swing state, and I know this isn’t sound logic to be representative of the country as a whole, but my own experience is that I can personally testify that Trump & right-wing media successfully captured my age group this time around. All but *two* of my male friends voted for Trump (all 18-22). In 2020, I can only think of one hardcore Trump supporter in the same friend group. 

We are all disappointed with the results, but just step back for a minute. This country swings left and right and left and right every single election. When all the trends are against Democrats, when every single government on Earth has lost reelection this year, is it so hard to believe Trump won legitimately without resorting to accusations of fraud?",2024-12-06 18:29:08

This is true power-the clarity of seeing this dynamic for what it is.

Conservatism prioritizes the preservation of traditional hierarchies, granting privileges, credibility, and resources to those at the top (in-groups) while imposing restrictions, scrutiny, and deprivation on those at the bottom (out-groups).

For hierarchists, **accusations often reflect less concern for the act itself and more for the perceived social standing of the person committing it**. Acts deemed acceptable for those at the top are condemned when performed by those at the bottom, as such acts are seen as privileges reserved for the higher ranks. **This dynamic, often marked by hypocrisy, is evident in cases like the disparate treatment of child abuse allegations within the Catholic Church versus the scrutiny directed at drag performers.**

At its core, the mantra of hierarchy remains: “Know your place.” Recognizing this mindset reveals how power structures perpetuate inequities and shape both perception and judgment.",2024-12-07 00:11:29
